Using a whitelist first approach to my online life is something I try really hard to do. I know I have weak points, where I get sucked into "doomscrolling" or
reading about hot trends. So I don't join or operate on social networks without a list of muted words.
I've also started making these lists public in order to help others.... and it's also a habit from my professional life!
